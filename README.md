## About the Game

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
